    <h1>Ancillary Boards</h1>
    <strong>an·cil·lar·y</strong><p> - (<i>adjective</i>)
        providing necessary support to the primary activities
        or operation of an organization, institution, industry,
        or system.
    </p><br>
    <p>The Cancer Support Center is fortunate to have ambassadors that help 
        spread the word about the important work done at The Center on behalf 
        of those living with cancer. In addition to The Center’s Board of Directors, 
        there are four ancillary boards that are committed to promoting and supporting
         The Center through their meetings and special events. The ancillary boards are: 
         the Women’s Board, the Homewood Community Board, the Mokena Community Board, 
         and the Junior Board.
    </p><br>
